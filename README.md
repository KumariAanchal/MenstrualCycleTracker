## Introduction
Welcome to the Menstrual Cycle Tracker project! This is a GitHub repository dedicated to building a menstrual cycle tracking application. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly tool for individuals to track their menstrual cycles, record symptoms, and gain insights into their reproductive health.

The Menstrual Cycle Tracker is designed to help users keep track of their periods, predict upcoming cycles, and monitor any changes or irregularities in their menstrual patterns. By maintaining a detailed record of their menstrual cycles, users can gain a better understanding of their bodies, plan activities accordingly, and identify any potential health concerns.

## Features

Cycle Analysis: The application analyzes the logged data to provide insights into the user's menstrual patterns, including cycle length and average duration.
Fertility Prediction: The tracker utilizes established algorithms to predict fertile days and ovulation based on the user's cycle history.
Symptom Logging: Users can record and track various symptoms experienced throughout their cycles, such as cramps, headaches, mood swings, and more.
Reminder Notifications: The application sends reminders to users for upcoming periods, fertile days, or medication intake.
Data Visualization: The tracker generates visual charts and graphs to present the user's menstrual history and symptom patterns in a clear and intuitive manner.
